#manual server code by pure python 

✅ How it works

GET request: Serves a simple HTML form.

POST request: Reads form input (name and email) and saves it into SQLite.

Database: Created automatically (data.db) with a users table.

2️⃣ How to Run

Save the code as server.py.

Run in terminal:

python server.py


Open browser: http://localhost:8080

Submit form → Data saved to data.db.

This is pure Python, no Flask or frameworks. You can even extend it to serve multiple pages or read stored data.
